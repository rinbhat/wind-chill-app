# ❄ Norway Wind Chill Dashboard

A real-time **wind chill analytics dashboard** built with Streamlit, Plotly, and the Open-Meteo API.

The app fetches hourly weather forecasts (temperature and wind speed) and calculates wind chill to visualize cold exposure across major Norwegian cities using interactive charts, heatmaps, gauges, leaderboards, and a live map.

## 🧮 Wind Chill Formula

```
WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215T − 11.37V^0.16 + 0.3965TV^0.16
```

Where:

* **T** = Temperature (°C)
* **V** = Wind speed (km/h)

If temperature > 10°C or wind speed < 4.8 km/h, wind chill equals actual temperature.
